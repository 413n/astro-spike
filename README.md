# Astro Spike (Hybrid)

This example includes some pages (a static page (pre-rendered), a SSR page, and a normal page) with a Counter and a Simple text component.

The counter is made of 2 components. The controller (logic of the counter) is handled inside a Solid component and the value displayed is rendered in a React component. This logic is powered by nanostores.
